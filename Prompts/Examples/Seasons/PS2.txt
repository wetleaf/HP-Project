Create an educational worksheet for 8-9-year-olds that involves understanding the seasons and calendar months. 
Provide a blank calendar template with spaces for the months of the year. 
Ask students to label each month with the appropriate season (e.g., December labeled as winter, June labeled as summer). 
Additionally, encourage students to mark holidays and events associated with each season. 
Include a brief description of the calendar layout and instructions for visual engagement. 
Do not include answers.
